# Discriminative Tasks in Computer Vision

Discriminative tasks in computer vision focus on analyzing and interpreting `visual data` to make accurate `classifications` and `identifications`. Unlike generative tasks, which involve creating or transforming images, discriminative tasks are concerned with `distinguishing` and `categorizing` images based on their content. Common examples include image classification, object detection, action recognition, and semantic segmentation.

The core of discriminative tasks lies in identifying distinctive features, patterns, and relationships within images. For instance:

- `Image classification` assigns a label to an entire image, enabling systems to categorize visual data efficiently.

- `Object detection` extends this by identifying individual objects and localizing them within an image using bounding boxes.

- `Action recognition` interprets human or object movements from image sequences.

- `Semantic segmentation` assigns labels to every pixel, ensuring fine-grained scene understanding.

Advancements in machine learning, particularly `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)` and other deep learning architectures, have greatly improved the `accuracy` and scalability of these tasks. A key factor in this progress is the use of `loss functions`, which measure prediction errors during training and guide models to refine their learning. The following sections provide a detailed review of the loss functions most commonly used across different discriminative tasks.
