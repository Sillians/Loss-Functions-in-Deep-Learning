# **Loss Functions for Tabular Data Prediction**

## **Overview**

Tabular data prediction is a core task in machine learning, involving structured datasets organized in rows and columns. Each row represents an observation, and each column represents features or variables. This type of data is common in domains such as **finance, healthcare, marketing, and logistics**.

The goal is to train models on historical data to learn patterns and relationships that can generalize to new, unseen data. Predictions may involve:

* **Regression tasks**: predicting continuous values (e.g., price, risk scores).
* **Classification tasks**: predicting discrete categories (e.g., loan approval, disease diagnosis).

Selecting the right **loss function** is central to model performance, as it directs optimization and parameter updates during training.

## **Common Loss Functions for Tabular Data**

### **Regression Tasks**

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures squared differences between predictions and actual values. Sensitive to outliers but widely used due to mathematical convenience.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE/L1)**: Measures absolute differences; more robust to outliers than MSE.

### **Classification Tasks**

* **Binary Cross-Entropy (Log Loss)**: Used for binary classification, penalizes incorrect probability predictions.
* **Categorical Cross-Entropy**: Extends BCE for multi-class classification.
* **Gini Impurity**: Used in tree-based models for classification to measure node purity.
