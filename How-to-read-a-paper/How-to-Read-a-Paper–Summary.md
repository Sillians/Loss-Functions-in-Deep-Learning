# How to Read a Paper – Summary

**Author:** S. Keshav, University of Waterloo

---

## **Abstract**

* Reading research papers is a fundamental activity for researchers.
* It is often inefficient due to lack of structured guidance.
* The paper introduces a **three-pass method** to read papers effectively.
* Also describes how this method can be extended to conduct a **literature survey**.

---

## **1. Introduction**

* Researchers read papers for:

  * Reviewing (conferences, classes).
  * Staying current in the field.
  * Conducting literature surveys.
* Graduate students typically learn through **trial and error**, leading to wasted effort.
* Keshav proposes a **systematic approach**: the **three-pass method**.

## **2. The Three-Pass Approach**

### **Overview**

* Instead of reading linearly, papers should be read in **up to three passes**.
* Each pass builds upon the previous one.

---

### **2.1 First Pass (5–10 minutes)**

**Goal:** Get a **bird’s-eye view** of the paper.

Steps:

1. Read the **title, abstract, and introduction**.
2. Read **section and subsection headings**.
3. Read the **conclusion**.
4. Glance at the **references** (check familiar ones).

At the end, answer the **Five Cs**:

1. **Category** – Type of paper (measurement, analysis, prototype?).
2. **Context** – Related works and theoretical basis.
3. **Correctness** – Are assumptions valid?
4. **Contributions** – Main contributions.
5. **Clarity** – Is the writing clear?

➡️ After this pass, decide whether to continue reading or stop.

### **2.2 Second Pass (up to 1 hour)**

**Goal:** Understand the **content without details**.

Actions:

* Read carefully, **ignore proofs**.
* Note **key points** and **margin comments**.
* Pay close attention to:

  * Figures, diagrams, graphs.
  * Proper labeling, error bars, statistical significance.
* Mark **unread references** for further exploration.

Result:

* You should be able to **summarize the paper’s main ideas and evidence**.
* Suitable for papers of interest but not in your specialty.

➡️ If still unclear:
(a) Set aside the paper.
(b) Return later after background study.
(c) Persevere to the **third pass**.

---

### **2.3 Third Pass (1–5 hours)**

**Goal:** Achieve **deep understanding**.

Approach:

* Try to **re-implement/recreate the paper** using the authors’ assumptions.
* Identify:

  * Innovations.
  * Weak points.
  * Hidden assumptions.
* Challenge every assumption and evaluate proofs/experiments critically.
* Compare presentation styles and extract **new techniques**.

Result:

* Ability to **reconstruct the paper’s structure from memory**.
* Identify **missing citations**, **implicit assumptions**, and **potential issues**.
* Generate **ideas for future work**.

---

## **3. Doing a Literature Survey**

* Literature surveys require reading **tens of papers**, often outside one’s field.

Steps:

1. **Initial Scan**:

   * Use Google Scholar/CiteSeer with keywords.
   * Do **one pass** on 3–5 recent papers.
   * Check related work sections → may find a survey paper.

2. **Identify Key Work**:

   * Look for **shared citations** and **frequent author names**.
   * Collect key papers and find recent publications from those authors.

3. **Conference Scan**:

   * Visit websites of **top conferences** in the field.
   * Skim proceedings for recent, high-quality work.
   * Perform **two passes** on collected papers.
   * Iterate if you discover additional key papers.

---

## **4. Experience**

* Author used this method for 15+ years:

  * Reading conference proceedings.
  * Writing reviews.
  * Doing background research.
* Benefits:

  * Prevents drowning in details too early.
  * Helps estimate review time.
  * Adjustable depending on time and purpose.

  2. Henning Schulzrinne – *Writing Technical Articles*.
  3. George Whitesides – *Writing a Paper*.

# **Key Takeaways**

* Use the **Three-Pass Method**:

  * **First Pass:** Bird’s-eye view (5–10 mins).
  * **Second Pass:** Content overview (up to 1 hour).
  * **Third Pass:** Deep understanding (1–5 hours).
* For **literature surveys**:

  * Start broad → Identify key works → Focus on top conferences.
* Critical skills:

  * Efficiency, clarity, identifying assumptions, and evaluating contributions.
