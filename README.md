## ABSTRACT

Loss functions lie at the core of deep learning, guiding models to minimize errors and shaping their ability to converge, generalize, and perform across tasks. This repository provides a comprehensive review of loss functions, from fundamental metrics such as `Mean Squared Error` and `Cross-Entropy` to advanced approaches like `Adversarial and Diffusion losses`. We explore their mathematical foundations, role in optimization, and strategic selection across domains including computer vision (discriminative and generative), tabular prediction, and time series forecasting. The review also highlights the historical evolution, computational considerations, and ongoing challenges in designing robust loss functions, with emphasis on scenarios involving multi-modal data, class imbalance, and real-world constraints. Finally, it outlines future directions, calling for adaptive loss functions that improve interpretability, scalability, and resilience in deep learning systems.

## Introduction

**Context & Motivation**

Progress in deep learning has been driven by advances in model architectures and optimization techniques. Early neural network models relied on simple loss functions, but the rise of complex architectures such as `Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)` and `Vision Transformers (ViTs)`, along with their application to diverse domains like computer vision, has demanded more specialized loss functions. These tailored functions play a critical role in effectively guiding learning, particularly when tackling challenges such as class imbalance, noisy data, and task-specific optimization.

**Loss function**

Loss functions are fundamental to deep learning, enabling the optimization of neural networks by quantifying the discrepancy between `predicted outputs` and `ground truth labels`. They are categorized based on task type. For `regression tasks` involving continuous data, common loss functions include `Mean Squared Error (MSE)` and `Mean Absolute Error (MAE)`, which measure the deviation between `predicted` and `actual values`. For classification tasks with categorical data, functions such as `Binary Cross-Entropy` and `Categorical Cross-Entropy` are widely used to capture the error in `predicted class probabilities`.

Beyond standard loss functions, specialized functions such as `Huber Loss`,`Hinge Loss`, and `Dice Loss` are employed for tasks that demand alternative error measurements. These custom functions address the unique requirements of domains like `object detection`, `image segmentation`, and `natural language processing`, where conventional loss functions may not be directly suitable. Selecting the appropriate loss function enables deep learning models to learn effectively from data, optimize their parameters, and achieve improved predictive performance.


The choice of an appropriate loss function greatly influences the training dynamics and overall accuracy of deep learning models. A well-selected loss function directs the optimization process toward minimizing prediction errors, enabling the model to converge effectively. Different loss functions emphasize distinct aspects of learning—for example, `penalizing outliers` more strongly or `addressing class imbalance`. Understanding these characteristics is critical for building robust models that generalize well to unseen data and perform reliably in real-world scenarios. Recently, researchers have explored combining multiple loss functions within a single training process to capture diverse objectives, as seen in applications like image generation, where factors such as resolution and refinement must be jointly optimized.

**Our contribution**

This paper highlights the pivotal role of loss functions in deep learning, with a particular focus on `computer vision` and related domains. In `computer vision`, loss functions are central to both `discriminative` tasks and `generative tasks`. Discriminative tasks, such as `image classification`, `object detection`, and `semantic segmentation` depend on loss functions to measure discrepancies between predicted labels and ground truth accurately. Generative tasks, including `text-to-image`, `image-to-image`, and `audio-to-image` generation, use loss functions to evaluate the `realism` and `quality` of generated outputs, often leveraging `adversarial` or `perceptual` losses to guide the training process effectively.

Beyond `computer vision`, this work also examines the role of loss functions in other `data modalities`, particularly tabular data prediction and time series forecasting. In `tabular prediction` tasks, selecting appropriate loss functions is vital for guiding learning on `structured datasets`, improving `prediction accuracy`, and addressing challenges such as `missing` or `imbalanced data`. For time series forecasting, where `sequential data` exhibits strong `temporal dependencies`, specialized loss functions are required to effectively capture these patterns and generate accurate forecasts.

This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of loss functions across `diverse deep learning tasks`, emphasizing their `historical evolution`, `current applications`, and `future research directions`. It presents a systematic categorization of loss functions by task type, outlining their `properties`, `functionalities`, and `computational implications`. By addressing both `theoretical` foundations and `practical` considerations, this work serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance the effectiveness of deep learning models through the careful selection and optimization of loss functions.
